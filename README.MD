NEOKOSMOS
─────────

The remnants of Atlantis lie scattered like forgotten dreams; barbarian hordes roam the untamed wilderness, their fierce spirits unyielding. Amidst the ruins of bygone glory, whispers abound of ancient magic—relics of a time when gods walked among mortals and wonders were wrought with but a word.

In this dark era of exploration and war, where the line between myth and reality blurs with each passing day, the remnants of civilization huddle behind thick walls—save those brave few adventurers. It is the time between the Age of Atlantis and the Age of Crushing Ice, where dreams of forgotten glory may be reclaimed and the world restored by one brave enough.

It is the age of high adventure!

Neokosmos is a dark fantasy adventure setting inspired by Robert E. Howard’s Hyperborea.
This setting contains mature material intended for adult audiences only.
It explores dark themes, intense violence, occult horror, and morally complex situations.
