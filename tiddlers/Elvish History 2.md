  The Shattering Years<br>
  <span style="font-size:1rem; opacity:0.85;">The Elves During the Cataclysm and the Rising of the Veil</span>
</h2>

<p>
When Atlantis tore its own heart open, the earth groaned beneath its weight. What humans remember as the single night in which the empire drowned in storm and fire was, for the elves, a catastrophe of deeper and stranger magnitude. They felt the unraveling of the leylines as if the world’s spirit itself had been pierced. Their magic—always a harmony with the currents of the earth—was thrown into violent dissonance.
</p>

<p>
No people suffered more from the breaking of magic than the elves.
</p>

  The First Convulsions of Leyline Collapse<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">0 — The Night of the Fall</span>
</h3>

<p>
When King Damakeron’s final experiment ruptured a great leyline beneath Atlantis, shockwaves rippled outward faster than wind or water.
</p>

<p>
To humans, these appeared as storms, earthquakes, tidal waves, burning rains.
<br>
To the elves—they struck the soul.
</p>

<p>
Elven mages, healers, diviners—any who had ever touched the currents—were overwhelmed by a force no mind was shaped to bear. Many fell unconscious; some died instantly. Illusions flickered and died. Wards that had guarded elven realms for millennia dissolved into harmless mist.
</p>

<p>
The Seasonal Courts, guardians of elven civilization for thousands of years, bore the full brunt of the magical collapse.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Fall of Yávië and Quellë<br>
<span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">The Courts That Perished</span></h3>

<p><strong>Two</strong> of the five royal families—the Courts of Yávië and Quellë—were destroyed entirely.</p>

<p><strong>House Yávië – The Court of Autumn</strong></p>

<p>
The artisans and foresighted scholars of Yávië were deeply attuned to the leylines. Their magic drew directly from nature’s resonance. When the leyline shattered, this resonance inverted into violent discord. Nearly every member of Yávië perished in the first hours. Their living cities—grown from centuries of shaped branches and roots—twisted, withered, or tore themselves apart.
</p>

<p><strong>House Quellë – The Court of Fading</strong></p>

<p>
The healers and contemplatives of Quellë fared no better. Their magic, woven through memory, dream, and transformation, was ripped apart as the Cataclysm ruptured the very fabric of spiritual magic. The Court dissolved in a single night—not by fire, but by the breaking of the harmony that sustained them. Their cities became silent ruins shrouded in unnatural fog.
</p>

<p>
No living elf today can claim descent from Yávië or Quellë; they are remembered only in song.
</p>

  The Diminishing of Hrívë<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">From Royal House to Lesser Standing</span>
</h3>

<p>
The Hrívë Court—keepers of winter knowledge and guardians of lore—survived, but shattered. Their seers had foreseen “a great shattering in the deep,” but their visions were fragmented by Atlantean interference and the scale of the true disaster. Many diviners perished instantly; others fell into permanent silence.
</p>

<p>
Though some families survived, Hrívë could no longer bear the duties of a royal house. Their remnants fled eastward, carrying fragments of their libraries. In the new age, Hrívë became a Lesser House—respected, but no longer sovereign.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  The Survival of Lairë and Tuilë<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">The Last Two Courts</span>
</h3>

<p>
Only two courts retained enough strength to rebuild elvenkind:
</p>

<p><strong>House Lairë – The Court of Summer</strong></p>
<p>
Joyous and vibrant, the Lairë elves lived far from the greatest leyline conduits. Their cities shook but did not collapse. They rallied survivors, tended the wounded, and established sanctuaries. Their vitality became the backbone of elven recovery.
</p>

<p><strong>House Tuilë – The Court of Spring</strong></p>

<p>
Adaptable and diplomatic, the Tuilë elves moved swiftly to locate survivors, transport refugees, and secure their lands. Their experience with humans and other peoples allowed them to organize the scattered remnants of elven civilization.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  The First Century After the Fall<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">Population Collapse and Human Pressure</span>
</h3>

<p>
Elven population collapsed to a fraction of its former size. Starvation, disorientation, and the destruction of their magical infrastructure claimed many more lives.
</p>

<p>
To the elves’ horror, desperate human populations—driven by fear and hunger—often viewed the weakened elves as threats or prizes. Some sought elven knowledge; others sought their lands; others feared them as remnants of the old magical age.
</p>

<p>
The elves, unable to harm humans, could not defend themselves.
<br>
This was the closest they have ever come to extinction.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  The Conclave of Two Courts<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">The Birth of the New Elven Kingdom</span>
</h3>

<p>
Lairë and Tuilë convened what later historians call the Conclave of Two Courts. Their goals were simple:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>protect the surviving population</li>
  <li>preserve culture and memory</li>
  <li>prevent further human encroachment</li>
  <li>restore the broken magical foundations</li>
</ul>

<p>
The seats of Yávië and Quellë were left empty—formally and forever.
</p>

<p>
Hrívë survived only as advisors and lorekeepers.
</p>

<p>
And a final decision was made:
<br>
<strong>the elves must withdraw from the world entirely.</strong>
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  The Rising of the Veil<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">~500 Years After the Fall</span>
</h3>

<p>
The Veil took centuries to weave. It was not a single spell, but a vast living enchantment crafted from the combined strength of Lairë and Tuilë, guided by the diminished Hrívë scholars.
</p>

<p>
The Veil:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>hid elven lands from human sight</li>
  <li>bent paths and memories so intruders wandered away harmlessly</li>
  <li>softened the recollection of those who strayed too near</li>
  <li>muted magical resonance detectable from afar</li>
  <li>stabilized the broken leyline remnants</li>
</ul>

<p>
When it finally rose, it shimmered across forests and mountains like a soft mirage. To humans, the elven realms simply ceased to exist.
</p>

<p>
For the elves, it was salvation—but also mourning. Their ancient courts were gone. Their numbers were diminished. Their culture survived only in fragments.
</p>

<p>
Yet through gentleness, patience, and hope, they endured.
<br>
The Veiled Kingdom began.
