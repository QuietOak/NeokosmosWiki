  Chapter II — The Atlantians
</h2>

<p><em>(Or “Atlanteans,” as older scholars prefer; many southern regions use “Atlantians,” and thus I record both.)</em></p>

<p>
It is a daunting task to write of a people whose greatness ended long before my own awakening, and whose civilization now sleeps beneath the waves. The Atlantians lived and perished thousands of years before the present age, and their vast empire crumbled in the Cataclysm that began the very calendar most humans now follow. Their memory lingers like a sharp wind—felt but unseen, powerful though intangible.
</p>

<p>
And yet, their shadow stretches across all of Neokosmos. Their ruins rise from jungles and deserts, their machines hum faintly beneath stone, and their blood flows still through many living peoples. Before I speak of those descendants, or of the mixed races such as the Matan, I must first describe the Atlantians themselves as best as I understand them.
</p>

<p>
What I record here comes from excavated histories, broken tablets, living myths, and—most surprisingly—my encounters with two Atlantians. One was truly alive. The other… was something else entirely, and I will not dwell on that being in this text. The first, however—Xanthe—has shaped my understanding immeasurably.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Form of the Atlantians</h3>

<p>
In every account, and in my own observations, Atlantians tower over all other peoples. It is said they were shaped by magic woven into their blood from the earliest days of their empire, and this seems entirely plausible when one stands beneath them.
</p>

<p>Atlantean women stand commonly between six and a half to seven and a half feet.</p>

<p>Atlantean men rise still higher—eight feet or more, tall enough that even human warriors look small in their presence.</p>

<p>
Their bodies are not merely tall but powerfully built, with long, elegant arms and slightly elongated necks—proportions that seem almost sculpted rather than grown. Their broad shoulders, muscular frames, and perfect posture lend them a luminous, commanding presence.
</p>

<p>
Their faces are fair and striking, often with high cheekbones and strong lines. Their skin carries a healthy, sun-touched glow even when they live far from warmth. Their hair is nearly always golden, thick, and worn long. Their eyes gleam in hues rare among other peoples: pale icy blues, shimmering silvers, or even luminous golds. In all my travels, no race bears such vividly colored eyes.
</p>

<p>
Many humans describe them as “otherworldly,” and I must confess that even I, trained in illusion and diplomacy, sometimes struggled not to stare.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Mystery of Their Civilization</h3>

<p>
Modern scholars agree that Atlantis stood at the pinnacle of human achievement. Their empire dominated both the physical world and the mystical, blending sorcery and technology in ways few can replicate even now.
</p>

<p>
They founded their first cities nearly 2000 years before the Fall.<br>
By 1200 B.F., they ruled nearly every known realm.
</p>

<p>
Yet for all their might, they remain a people cloaked in contradiction.
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>They were conquerors, yet scholars.</li>
  <li>Masters of magic, yet slaves to ambition.</li>
  <li>A people of beauty, yet doomed by their own brilliance.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Many stories paint them as tyrants, but Xanthe’s quiet sorrow when describing her home told me a different truth. They were flawed, proud, fearful, kind, curious—human in every way, except in scale and legacy.
</p>

<p>
Atlantis was not merely an empire; it was a dream of perfect knowledge.<br>
And, like many dreams, it consumed the dreamers.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Legacy of Atlantis in Neokosmos</h3>

<p>
Though the empire is gone, its influence is alive everywhere.
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>The Ruestrian Empire proudly claims noble houses with “Atlantean blood.”</li>
  <li>The ruins of Deutera Atlantis lie beneath modern Fresnia and the southern coasts.</li>
  <li>Atlantean vault-machines still hum with mysterious energies.</li>
  <li>The ancient Elven Project left deep marks on both our peoples.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Even now, two and a half millennia after the Fall, wanderers scour the continent for artifacts, writings, and devices. Some seek knowledge. Others seek power. Rumors now spread of a sword found near Ruestria, attributed to Damakeron himself—a discovery that has shaken scholars in every domain.
</p>

<p>But that chapter, too, is for later pages.</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">My Encounter with Xanthe</h3>

<p>
Of all my studies, none has shaped my understanding of Atlantis more than the living woman I met: Xanthe.
</p>

<p>
She was discovered within a strange Atlantean device—something between a coffin and a cradle—preserved in a peaceful sleep for more than a thousand years. When she awoke, the world she knew had vanished. Her family, her culture, her city—all lost beneath the waves.
</p>

<h4 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1rem;">Her appearance</h4>

<p>
Xanthe is the tallest woman I have ever seen, standing a full head above even the tallest Ruestrian soldiers. Her features are elegant but foreign to the eye, with long limbs and a poise that seems innate. Her hair is a soft gold, her skin smooth and unmarred, and her eyes shine with a strange golden light.
</p>

<p>
She moves like someone raised in comfort. She startles easily. She speaks in a soft, cautious voice, as though words might betray her. She is gentle and exceedingly polite, but sorrow rests heavily upon her—like winter snow clinging to a branch.
</p>

<h4 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1rem;">What she taught me</h4>

<p>
Xanthe shared what she remembered of her world, though she often hesitated, uncertain whether her memories would bring pain. From her I learned:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>The Atlantians were not invincible, nor cold, nor cruel by nature.</li>
  <li>They valued beauty, luxury, and knowledge above all things.</li>
  <li>Their empire was filled with laughter and art as much as with ambition.</li>
  <li>Even at their height, they feared the vastness of magic.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Xanthe reminded me that great civilizations are still made of people—flawed, hopeful, and vulnerable.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Shadow of Damakeron (Briefly Noted)</h3>

<p>
I will not recount in this chapter the full tale of King Damakeron, for his story belongs to another essay entirely. I will only say this:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>His works fractured the world.</li>
  <li>He sought to bind the leylines.</li>
  <li>He became something no longer human.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And his presence lingers like a cold wind in dreams.
</p>

<p>
I met, once, a thing that bore the echo of his legacy.<br>
It is not my place to speak further of it.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>
The Atlantians were giants in every sense—physically, magically, culturally. Their imprint upon the world is so vast that even elves, who lived long before their rise, must acknowledge their significance.
</p>

<p>Their fall reshaped the leylines.<br>
Their ruins still hum with silent power.<br>
Their blood remains in the veins of kings and wanderers alike.</p>

<p>
If elves are the memory of the world, then Atlantians are its legend.<br>
Great, tragic, and forever echoing through the ages.
</p>
