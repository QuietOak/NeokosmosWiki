  3 — The Matan
</h1>

<h2 style="color:#f0dfc4; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  Chapter III — The Matan
</h2>

<p><em>(A corruption of the Atlantean word <strong>Mátani</strong>, meaning “mixed”)</em></p>

<p>
Among all the peoples of Neokosmos, none are so widespread, so varied, nor so quick to reshape the world around them as the Matan—the great tapestry of humankind woven from every race once bound beneath the banner of the Atlantean Empire. They are the children of movement, of mingling, of a thousand journeys taken unwillingly or freely depending on the age. And though some kingdoms insist fiercely upon distinctions between themselves, to my eyes—and to the eyes of any elf—they are one people.
</p>

<p>
I do not write this to diminish their identities. Only to express what is true in the long vision of the elven mind: even the proud Ruestrian noble, the steadfast Fresnian warrior, and the cunning Alnhaman merchant share a common root. Their lines diverged only recently—within a span scarcely longer than one of my own life cycles. That they do not see this only amuses me gently, and I hope kindly.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Origins of the Matan</h3>

<p>
Under the Atlantean Empire, the world was not merely conquered—it was reshaped. Peoples from far continents were moved, resettled, relocated, and absorbed into the machine of empire. Sometimes this was done to quell rebellions. Sometimes to cultivate labor in distant provinces. And often simply because the Atlantean governors believed efficient societies required controlled mixtures of culture.
</p>

<p>
Over millennia, these movements blended countless lineages. By the final centuries of Atlantis:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li><strong>Pureborn Atlanteans</strong> were elite aristocrats</li>
  <li><strong>Elves</strong> were distant allies or coerced subjects</li>
  <li><strong>And the vast majority of the population were Matan</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
The Matan lived in city underlevels, farmed the plains, served on ships, crafted tools, and raised families. Their origins became so interwoven that even the Atlanteans themselves eventually used the word <em>Mátani</em> simply to mean “the common people.”
</p>

<p>
After the Cataclysm, when Atlantis vanished beneath the sea, it was not the few pureborn survivors who rebuilt the world—it was the Matan.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Form of the Matan</h3>

<p>
In general appearance, the Matan stand between elves and Atlanteans in height:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Most men and women range from 5 feet to 6½ feet,</strong><br>
with taller individuals often boasting a trace of Atlantean blood.
</p>

<p>Their features vary greatly, but certain patterns endure:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Dark hair and brown or black eyes are the most common traits.</li>
  <li>Sun-warmed skin dominates the central plains and coasts.</li>
  <li>Fairer skin and pale hair often signal distant Atlantean ancestry.</li>
  <li>Strong builds and remarkable endurance are nearly universal.</li>
</ul>

<p>
They are, in truth, quite beautiful in a sturdy, warm, and practical way. Their hands bear marks of work; their faces carry expression in ways elves seldom show.
</p>

<p>
Compared to elves, their emotional lives seem both more turbulent and more vivid. I confess I have often been startled by how quickly a Matan will laugh, or shout, or weep—reactions my people feel but seldom display outwardly.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Their Great Strength: Adaptability</h3>

<p>
If the Atlanteans shaped the world, the Matan are the ones who remade it.
</p>

<p>
Their adaptability astonishes me. They learn with breathtaking speed—sometimes too quickly for my mind to follow. They can conquer oceans, rebuild cities, navigate deserts, rediscover old technologies, and understand foreign tongues with an ease that borders on magic.
</p>

<p>In only a few centuries after the Fall:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>They restored maritime routes lost since the Cataclysm.</li>
  <li>They rebuilt shattered kingdoms atop Deutera Atlantis.</li>
  <li>They founded Ruestria, Alnhama, and Fresnia.</li>
  <li>They reopened ruins and repurposed Atlantean devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To elves, whose changes unfold across long seasons, the rapid rise of the Matan is astonishing. They are like fire—bright, quick, unpredictable, transformative.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Their Great Burden: Violence</h3>

<p>
It saddens me to write this, for I care deeply for many of the Matan I met, but their acceptance of violence troubles me more than any other aspect of their culture.
</p>

<p>
To them, conflict is a tool.<br>
A means of shaping the world.<br>
Sometimes even a necessity.
</p>

<p>
Kingdoms rise and fall by the sword.<br>
Disputes are settled by force.<br>
Bravery is often measured by willingness to shed blood.
</p>

<p>
To my people, this is incomprehensible. The elves do not possess the impulse to harm other speaking beings, and thus every war, duel, and raid I encountered left a lingering ache in my heart.
</p>

<p>
Worse still is the way some Matan covet elven magic. They sense its serenity and believe it a thing to be <em>possessed</em> rather than understood. This desire was one reason the Veil was raised five centuries after the Fall; our people could not survive kingdoms hungry for power in every shadow.
</p>

<p>
And yet, I cannot condemn them. Violence among the Matan is born not from malice but from fear, hunger, desperation, and the swift turning of their years. Their lives pass quickly, and urgency drives them into conflict.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">A People of Warmth and Wonder</h3>

<p>
For all their flaws, for all their sad acceptance of harm, the Matan possess qualities that fill me with admiration.
</p>

<p>They are:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Hospitable to strangers</li>
  <li>Curious about the unknown</li>
  <li>Inventive with tools and trade</li>
  <li>Courageous in danger</li>
  <li>Eager to connect, even with elves like myself</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of my dearest friends are Matan. They welcomed me into their homes, taught me their customs, shared their meals, and tried—unsuccessfully—to teach me how to haggle. Their laughter was kind.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Matan as the Heirs of the World</h3>

<p>
In truth, the Matan are now the dominant people of Neokosmos.
</p>

<p>
They thrive where others falter.<br>
They rebuild where others mourn.<br>
They dream when hope seems thin.
</p>

<p>
In them, I see echoes of their Atlantean ancestors: ambition, resilience, ingenuity. But I also see something uniquely their own: a willingness to begin again, no matter how many times the world falls.
</p>

<p>
If Atlantis was the world’s golden age,<br>
then the Matan are its iron heart—strong, enduring, ever beating.
