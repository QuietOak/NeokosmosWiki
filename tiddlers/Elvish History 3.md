  The Long Recovery<br>
  <span style="font-size:1rem; opacity:0.85;">
    From the Rising of the Veil (ca. 500 A.F.) to the Present (~2500 A.F.)
  </span>
</h2>

<p>
The centuries following the Cataclysm were, for elvenkind, an age of quiet endurance. Though hidden from the world, they faced their greatest challenge yet: survival without the full strength of their ancient courts, with their population devastated, and their magical foundation fractured.
</p>

<p>
The two remaining royal houses—Lairë (Summer) and Tuilë (Spring)—took on roles once shared among all five. Necessity became tradition, and their partnership shaped the next two millennia of elven history.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  The Rule of the Twin Courts<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">Summer and Spring Share the Year</span>
</h3>

<p>
With Yávië and Quellë gone and Hrívë diminished, the elves revived an ancient emergency custom known as the <strong>Cycle of Stewardship</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Under this system:
</p>

<p><strong>House Lairë</strong> rules during the warm half of the year (midspring to early autumn).</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Village renewal</li>
  <li>Harvest oversight</li>
  <li>Training guardians and watchers</li>
  <li>Celebration rites and communal gatherings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>House Tuilë</strong> rules during the cold half of the year (late autumn to early spring).</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Internal diplomacy</li>
  <li>Magical planning</li>
  <li>Dreamweaving and scholarly study</li>
  <li>Maintenance of the Veil’s foundations</li>
</ul>

<p>
Authority passes between the courts with ritual grace rather than rivalry. Across two thousand years, this cycle continued without a single recorded conflict—an accomplishment unparalleled among mortal peoples.
</p>

<p>
The Hrívë remnants became the lorekeepers, teachers, and quiet backbone of elven renewal.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  The Sustaining of the Veil<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">
    A Wall of Mist, Memory, and Woven Magic
  </span>
</h3>

<p>
The Veil, raised after the Cataclysm, was a living enchantment: woven into mountain, forest, water, and air. Maintaining it required continuous effort, especially while the leylines remained unstable.
</p>

<p>
For centuries, nearly a third of all elves devoted their lives to sustaining it:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li><strong>illusionists</strong> weaving shifting mirages into mountain passes</li>
  <li><strong>mistweavers</strong> renewing the enchanted fogs</li>
  <li><strong>dream-callers</strong> softening memories of humans who strayed too close</li>
  <li><strong>geomancers</strong> stabilizing fractured leyline nodes</li>
  <li><strong>seasonal rites</strong> renewing the enchantments twice yearly</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Veil avoided harm entirely. It made travelers turn aside, lose interest, forget their purpose, or believe the route impassable. Only through the unity of Lairë and Tuilë—and tireless generations of mages—did it survive the first millennium.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  The Founding of Velatasia<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">
    The Hidden Kingdom of the Elves
  </span>
</h3>

<p>
In the early centuries, the elves gathered their scattered survivors into a single homeland—chosen for its natural defenses and strong magical resonance. Thus was founded <strong>Velatasia</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Velatasia lies:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>behind jagged, near-impassable mountains</li>
  <li>surrounded by enchanted forests veiled in mist</li>
  <li>threaded with softened leylines calmed by elven magic</li>
</ul>

<p>
Within the Veil, it is a sanctuary of:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>villages grown into groves and glades</li>
  <li>terraced gardens aligned to leyline harmonics</li>
  <li>crystalline lakes and spell-kept streams</li>
  <li>paths lit by lanterns that never flicker</li>
</ul>

<p>
While the outside world rose and fell through war and empire, Velatasia remained untouched and unseen.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  Melianthor<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">The Heart of Elven Magic and Royal Seat</span>
</h3>

<p>
At the center of Velatasia stands <strong>Melianthor</strong>, the last great elven castle—grown from ancient living stone and shaped by magic into spiraling towers, arches, and branch-like bridges.
</p>

<p>
Here reside:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>the royal families of Lairë and Tuilë</li>
  <li>the Council of Loremasters (descendants of Hrívë)</li>
  <li>the Circle of Veilwardens</li>
  <li>apprentices of illusion, mist-weaving, divination, subtle magics</li>
</ul>

<p>
Melianthor’s <strong>Whisperpeak</strong>, the tallest tower, remains the central node anchoring the Veil’s lattice.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  Human Encroachment and Fresnian Obsession<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">Attempts to Breach the Veil</span>
</h3>

<p>
Though many human kingdoms forgot the elves entirely, a few—especially scholars of Deutera Atlantis and later Fresnia—never abandoned the old legends. By ~1800 A.F., Fresnian researchers believed elven lands held the key to Atlantean relics.
</p>

<p>
Their motives were mixed; their methods dangerous.
</p>

<p>
Recorded attempts include:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>seven major expeditions seeking mountain passes</li>
  <li>two attempts to cut through the Veil using Atlantean artifacts</li>
  <li>countless lost scouting parties</li>
  <li>a disastrous relic misfire (~2200 A.F.) that ruptured a portion of the Veil for three days</li>
</ul>

<p>
Though none have reached Velatasia or Melianthor, Fresnian persistence continues—driven by equal parts fear and ambition.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  The Present Era<br>
  <span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">A Kingdom Hidden, Yet Not Forgotten</span>
</h3>

<p>
Now, two millennia after the Fall, Velatasia remains sealed behind its mists. The elves have recovered—slowly, but never entirely. Their numbers remain small, their magic carefully regulated, their hopes cautious.
</p>

<p>
The Lairë and Tuilë Courts still share rule in alternation.
<br>
The Hrívë lineages still preserve memory.
<br>
The Veil still stands—because it must.
</p>

<p>
For if it ever falls, elvenkind may not survive another age of mortal ambition.
