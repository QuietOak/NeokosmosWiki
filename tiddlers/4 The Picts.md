  4 — The Picts
</h1>

<h2 style="color:#f0dfc4; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  Chapter IV — The Peoples Wrongly Called “Picts”
</h2>

<p>
Among all the subjects I have studied during my travels, none has weighed more heavily upon my heart than the people commonly — and often carelessly — called Picts. This chapter is the most difficult I have written. Not because the people themselves are hard to understand, but because the human understanding of them is so deeply flawed.
</p>

<p>
The word Pict has become a net cast far too wide.<br>
It is used to name a single people, yet it ensnares dozens.<br>
It is used to justify fear, yet it blinds those who speak it.
</p>

<p>
I have met many of these so-called “Picts.” Some were nothing alike in speech, custom, or form. Some had never even heard the word. Some were offended by it. And others embraced it out of necessity, or pride, or simply because no one bothered to ask their true names.
</p>

<p>This chapter is my attempt to honor them by telling the truth as best I can.</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Common Perception</h3>

<p>
In the courts of Ruestria, in the docks of Alnhama, in the halls of Fresnia, the word Pict is spoken with the same meaning:
</p>

<p>
A barbarian from the north.<br>
Short, dark-skinned, black-haired, black-eyed.<br>
Broad-shouldered, deep-chested, lean-hipped.<br>
Clothed only in hides.
</p>

<p>
This description, repeated endlessly across centuries, has become the “standard” human view of the Picts.
</p>

<p>
And yet it is wrong.<br>
Deeply wrong.<br>
Dangerously wrong.
</p>

<p>
It describes only one group — one tribe of the earliest migrants from Hyperborea around 700 years after the Fall. Even that tribe, as I learned from one of their descendants who guided me across the highlands, has changed greatly since those early accounts.
</p>

<p>
To apply this description to everyone from the northern sea is like calling every Matan “Ruestrian” simply because the first merchant you met wore a red cloak.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The First Crossings</h3>

<p>
Historical records — Atlantean, Deutera, even early Fresnian — agree on one point: around 700 A.F., <strong>multiple</strong> seafaring peoples arrived from Hyperborea. But these were not united migrations. They were:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Tribes fleeing colder seasons behind advancing ice</li>
  <li>Fishing clans seeking new shores</li>
  <li>Warriors escaping clan feuds</li>
  <li>Nomads driven by shifting northern storms</li>
  <li>Smaller folk remembered only in songs</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first of these were the people now called the Picts. They were indeed dark-haired, dark-eyed, and short compared to the Matan, with great strength and resilience.
</p>

<p>
But they were not alone.<br>
They were merely the first.
</p>

<p>After them came others, wildly different in appearance:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Tall red-haired warriors with storm-grey eyes</li>
  <li>Snake-cloaked mystics with eastern features</li>
  <li>Slender fisherfolk carving spirals into driftwood</li>
  <li>Pale nomads with blue warpaint</li>
  <li>Traders who spoke three tongues</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yet all of them — all of them — were called Picts by the settled kingdoms of Neokosmos.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">How One Name Became Many</h3>

<p>
Humans often compress the complexities of the world for convenience. Not out of malice — simply haste.
</p>

<p>
To Ruestrian scribes, any northerner was “a Pict.”<br>
To Alnhaman merchants, any hostile sailor was “a Pictish pirate.”<br>
To Fresnian storytellers, every northern warrior was “a Pict come to test his mettle.”
</p>

<p>
Thus a single name expanded like a shadow at dusk.
</p>

<p>
By the time I was born, the world had forgotten that “Pict” referred to only one of many Hyperborean tribes — and that even they were not what legend paints.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Truth of the First Picts</h3>

<p><strong>What is known with certainty:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>They stood between five and five and a half feet tall.</li>
  <li>Their skin ranged from sun-browned to olive, rarely darker.</li>
  <li>Black hair and eyes were common.</li>
  <li>Their minimal clothing reflected climate, not savagery.</li>
  <li>Their carvings in bone and darkwood were exquisite.</li>
</ul>

<p>
They did not come to conquer. They came because storms behind them worsened, and the lands ahead were open.
</p>

<p>
When later tribes arrived and mingled with them, distinctions blurred. Within three generations, they were a tapestry of faces and customs.
</p>

<p>Yet the world kept calling all of them Picts.</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">A Scholar’s Responsibility</h3>

<p>
I cannot force humans to abandon the term. But I can record the truth:
</p>

<p>
“Pict” describes a <em>moment</em> in history, not a single people.<br>
It is a misremembered name stretched over dozens of cultures.<br>
It hides the diversity of the northern migrants.
</p>

<p>
Many of these tribes deserve their true names — some of which I learned from my northern guide, whom I will speak of in my personal notes.
</p>

<p>
If this chapter convinces even one scholar to choose precision over assumption, it will have been worth writing.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>
Elves, too, are often misnamed — called Fair Folk, spirits, or demons, as though we have no courts, clans, or histories of our own. I understand, then, how a name can flatten a people into myth.
</p>

<p>
The Picts — and the hundreds wrongly labeled as such — deserve more.
</p>

<p>
They deserve to be known.<br>
They deserve to be understood.<br>
They deserve their true names.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#f0dfc4; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  Additional Peoples Wrongly Grouped as “Picts”
</h2>

<p>
Across the sea are countless tribes — each with its own rites, laws, bodies, and spirits. To call all of them “Picts” is as inaccurate as calling every Matan a Ruestrian.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Bear Tribe — <em>Ursakirr</em></h3>

<p>
Of all the northern peoples, none struck me with such awe — or fear — as the Bear Tribe. They dwell in frozen lands where the cold burns deeper than fire. Life there demands strength, and strength is their measure of all things.
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Massive bodies, towering over most humans</li>
  <li>Pale skin, thick blond hair, icy blue eyes</li>
  <li>Muscles like carved winter stone</li>
  <li>Scars worn proudly — but never self-inflicted</li>
  <li>Mercy is not a virtue; survival is</li>
</ul>

<p>
I often felt very small near them. Yet something pure, almost childlike, lived beneath their fierce simplicity.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Shadowfang Tribe — <em>Sha’dunvar</em></h3>

<p>
These people dwell in the darkest forests, where moonlight barely reaches the ground. Their skin is dark, their eyes gleam like obsidian shards, and they walk with uncanny silence.
</p>

<p>
Hunters, herbalists, poisoners, spirit-listeners — their lives are woven into the forest’s breath.
</p>

<p>
But I sensed a deeper thread beneath their ways:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Rituals tied to moon-cycles and unseen spirits</li>
  <li>Clothing of bark, feathers, leather</li>
  <li>Ambush tactics of frightening effectiveness</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yet something old and corrupt clings to their rites — a presence they call the “Moon-Shadow.” Whether Hyperborean or a remnant of Damakeron’s broken leyline, I cannot say.
</p>

<p>
Still, their courtesy toward me was quiet and sincere.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Horse Tribe — <em>Talvarkhaan</em></h3>

<p>
On the wide eastern plains, I found the Horse Tribe — though they were often already racing past before I could study them.
</p>

<p>
They live for motion, speed, and the hunt. Bronze skin, wind-burned; blue restless eyes; vivid garments; and chariots designed for deadly precision.
</p>

<p><strong>Their chariot-teams:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>One driver steering at incredible speeds</li>
  <li>Two women fighting beside him — javelins, spears, bows</li>
</ul>

<p>
Greed is not shameful to them — it is celebrated, a mark of ambition. Yet they laugh easily, even with strangers.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Boar Tribe — <em>Gorathrim</em></h3>

<p>
Often forgotten in larger accounts, yet dearest to me — for my northern guide was born among them.
</p>

<p>The Boar Tribe is defined by endurance:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Practical, sturdy bodies</li>
  <li>Earth-colored hair and eyes</li>
  <li>Survival in harsh terrain</li>
  <li>Understanding of weather, land, and war-bands</li>
</ul>

<p>
Known as mercenaries, they fight not for glory but for:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Family</li>
  <li>Survival</li>
  <li>Necessity</li>
</ul>

<p>
My guide corrected my mislabels gently, taught me true names, and showed me how a careless word can erase a people.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Final Observation: Many Peoples, One Misnomer</h3>

<p>
To call all these tribes “Picts” is not merely inaccurate — it is a dismissal of their identities, histories, and humanity.
</p>

<p>
A word meant for one tribe has been stretched over an entire world.
</p>

<p>
I hope future scholars choose names with greater care.
