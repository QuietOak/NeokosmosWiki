  The Elder Age of the Elves  
  <span style="font-size:1rem; opacity:0.85;">A Concise History Before the Fall of Atlantis</span>
</h2>

<p>
The elves were among the earliest peoples to awaken in Neokosmos, emerging in the deep forests long before the shaping of human kingdoms. Their earliest eras remain half-remembered even in their own surviving lore, but the broad strokes of their civilization are preserved with clarity and consistency across all sources.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Blossoming Era<br>
<span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">~5000 to ~3500 years Before the Fall</span></h3>

<p>
Elven tradition claims their awakening occurred “in the quiet after the melting of the ice,” when the world was recovering from ancient glacial dominion. Their earliest societies were scattered through the great forests, living in loose communities united by shared song, ritual, and the instinctive harmony of their pacifistic nature.
</p>

<p>
They had no kings, nor saw need for them. Leadership was soft, communal, guided by consensus rather than decree. Magic permeated their lives like breath: illusions used for art and childhood play, protective mists woven against wandering beasts, dreams interpreted through subtle divinations.
</p>

<p>
As centuries passed, scattered communities drifted together into greater centers of culture—what would later become the first elven kingdoms. Unlike human empires, which often rise atop conquered rivals, the elves united not through conquest but through mutual attraction, shared curiosity, and the slow weaving of harmony.
</p>

<p>
This was the Blossoming Era, when elven cities grew beneath ancient boughs, shaped from living branches bent into halls and towers. Songs from this era still echo in their histories: songs of learning, of growth, of memory.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Founding of the Five Royal Families<br>
<span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">~3500 to ~3200 Before the Fall</span></h3>

<p>
As elven populations grew and their settlements matured, a need for structured governance emerged—not from strife, but from the increasing complexity of managing magic, lore, craft, and the watchful stewardship of the mortal peoples now wandering the world.
</p>

<p>
Thus began what later historians call <em>The Concord of Seasons.</em>
</p>

<p>
Five elders—each representing one of the great regions and temperaments of elvenkind—bound themselves into a pact of stewardship. Their houses were named for the seasonal cycle preserved in ancient elven scholarship:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li><strong>House Tuilë — Spring:</strong> Renewal, exploration, diplomacy</li>
  <li><strong>House Lairë — Summer:</strong> Life, celebration, guardianship</li>
  <li><strong>House Yávië — Autumn:</strong> Harvest, craft, foresight</li>
  <li><strong>House Quellë — Fading:</strong> Contemplation, healing, subtle magics</li>
  <li><strong>House Hrívë — Winter:</strong> Memory, mysticism, preservation of lore</li>
</ul>

<p>
These were not dynasties in the human sense; membership was determined by affinity, temperament, and recognition rather than strict bloodline. Even so, over centuries, families came to be closely associated with each house.
</p>

<p>
Together, the Five Royal Families formed the Seasonal Courts—a decentralized yet remarkably stable system of governance. Each court presided over distinct domains such as law, magic, diplomacy, preservation, and lore, while all five shared equal authority in matters affecting elvenkind.
</p>

<p>
This system endured thousands of years with almost no internal division, a feat that still astonishes human scholars.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Age of Watching Humanity<br>
<span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">~3000 to ~2000 Before the Fall</span></h3>

<p>
As humans expanded through Neokosmos, elves observed them quietly. Humans—young, swift-lived, daring—fascinated the elves even as they troubled them. The elves had no wish to rule or restrain, but they feared what ambitious mortals might unleash with poorly understood magic.
</p>

<p>
Thus began the <strong>Elven Watch</strong>, a subtle surveillance carried out by the Seasonal Courts:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li><strong>Tuilë emissaries</strong> guided human cultures toward peaceful growth.</li>
  <li><strong>Yávië artisans</strong> shared safe crafts to uplift early cities.</li>
  <li><strong>Quellë healers</strong> advised in dreams or illusions.</li>
  <li><strong>Hrívë seers</strong> watched the leylines for dangerous shifts.</li>
  <li><strong>Lairë guardians</strong> warded forests to prevent reckless magic.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Their interventions were subtle and non-violent; humans often never realized the help they received. This gentle balance held for centuries—until the rise of Atlantis.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Atlantean Ascendance<br>
<span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">~2000 to ~1200 Before the Fall</span></h3>

<p>
When the Republic of Atlantis emerged as a center of learning and exploration, its sages quickly recognized elven magic. Early relations were respectful; Atlantean philosopher-statesmen sought knowledge rather than dominance, and the elves admired their ordered curiosity.
</p>

<p>
But the transformation of Atlantis from republic to empire altered everything.
</p>

<p>
Driven by ambition, Atlantean mages pursued mastery of the leylines with intensity the elves found troubling. They interpreted elven harmony not as a philosophy but as a resource—a key to stabilizing dangerous magical experiments.
</p>

<p>
Treaties were forged. Exchanges increased. The Elven Project, envisioned as a collaboration, began under cautious optimism.
</p>

<p>
Yet the Atlanteans learned quickly—and pushed far past what the elves considered safe.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Subtle Ensnaring of the Elves<br>
<span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">~1200 to ~800 Before the Fall</span></h3>

<p>
As Atlantis expanded, the elves became increasingly entangled in its ambitions. Atlanteans sought:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>elven resonance to stabilize volatile leyline experiments</li>
  <li>elven veils to hide arcane facilities</li>
  <li>elven divination to foresee magical fallout</li>
  <li>elven healers to mend those injured by uncontrolled power</li>
</ul>

<p>
The elves, trusting and pacifistic, initially cooperated—believing they could prevent misuse by guiding human research.
</p>

<p>
But gradually, collaboration became coercion:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Atlantean expeditions trespassed into elven lands</li>
  <li>elven crafts were seized and replicated</li>
  <li>scholars were pressured to remain in Atlantean cities indefinitely</li>
</ul>

<p>
There was no war—there could never be war, for elves are incapable of waging it. Instead there was erosion: a soft subjugation, a quiet siphoning of autonomy.
</p>

<p>
By Damakeron’s reign, Atlantis did not rule the elves in name, but in practice their knowledge and essence fueled engines of empire they neither desired nor controlled.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Last Calm Before the Storm<br>
<span style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85;">~800 to ~350 Before the Fall</span></h3>

<p>
Within elven society, the Seasonal Courts faced the greatest dilemma in their long history:
</p>

<p>
Withdraw entirely and risk enraging Atlantis,<br>
or continue cooperating and risk enabling disaster.
</p>

<p>
Warning signs grew:
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>Hrívë seers foretold a “shattering in the deep places.”</li>
  <li>Yávië artisans sensed instability in the leylines.</li>
  <li>Lairë guardians felt shadows passing through their groves.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yet the elves could not act decisively; decisive action requires confrontation, and elves are not shaped for confrontation.
</p>

<p>
Thus the world drifted toward ruin while the elves—ancient, wise, gentle—watched with sorrow.
</p>

<p>
Their final attempt to withdraw cooperation would come too late.  
For Atlantis was already nearing the precipice.
</p>
