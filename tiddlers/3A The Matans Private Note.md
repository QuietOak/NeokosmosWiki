  On Melisende of the Ruestrian Empire
</h3>

<p>
Melisende is, perhaps, the bravest person I have ever met. Not in the way humans often speak of bravery—charging into battle, or standing firm in danger—but in the quiet way she continues to live despite fear seeping into the edges of every breath.
</p>

<p>
She was not trained in magic. She did not seek it. She was born with fire inside her—wild, hungry, impossible to contain. A legacy of the ancient Elven Project, twisted and diluted through generations of Matan ancestry until it emerged in her as something raw and uncontrolled.
</p>

<p>
Her body bears the marks of it. Burn scars wrap around her arms, across her side, and beneath her collarbone like pale, painful threads. She believes them hideous. I do not. To me they resemble the bark of a fire-scarred tree that continues stubbornly to grow.
</p>

<p>
She is short for a Matan, lean yet softly curved. Her black hair—so striking at first glance—is broken by large white patches left by shocks of uncontrolled magic. She hides these streaks behind shawls or hoods, as though they betray something shameful. Her eyes are soft, weary green, flickering from shadow to shadow as though expecting harm from every direction.
</p>

<p>
When I first met her, she flinched when I spoke her name.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">On Her Magic</h3>

<p>
Her fire is not like human sorcery, nor anything like elven evocation. It leaps from her in unpredictable storms when she is terrified or angry. I once saw her hands ignite without flame—heat shimmering as though the world itself bent around her fear.
</p>

<p>
She calls herself cursed. But I know the truth: her ancestors were touched by the same misguided experiments that sought to blend elven and human magic. The Elven Project left many legacies among the Matan.
</p>

<p>
But no elf ever manifested fire like this.<br>
It is something new—something uniquely human.
</p>

<p>
When I began teaching her calming illusions, she watched with trembling wonder, seeing gentle magic for the first time. Her flames responded—softly, curling inward rather than outward, like a frightened creature soothed by touch.
</p>

<p>
To think a Matan peasant could command—however reluctantly—magic beyond anything my people could shape… it humbles me.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">On Her Hardship</h3>

<p>
Melisende lived alone for years, hiding from the Ruestrian clergy who feared her magic and from neighbors who saw her as a danger. She bartered for food when she could, scavenged when she could not, and slept in barns or abandoned shrines.
</p>

<p>
She told me once, with a voice small as frost, that she had not been embraced by another person since childhood.
</p>

<p>
Her loneliness is a wound deeper than any burn.
</p>

<p>
I wish the Matan could see that fear should lead to compassion, not exile. But they hide what frightens them. Elves, too, cannot help her fully—we must remain hidden from those who would seek our power.
</p>

<p>
Still… I often wish the world were kinder to her.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">On Our Friendship</h3>

<p>
She is timid, soft-spoken, often frightened—but she tries. She apologizes constantly for things not her fault. She laughs in nervous little gasps. She will not touch a new object without asking permission.
</p>

<p>
But sometimes, when she forgets to fear, she speaks passionately about wanting a home—a place to belong without hiding.
</p>

<p>
I do not know if I may call her friend, but I hope so. I see such strength in her—strength of survival, gentleness, and enduring a world that has given her so little kindness.
</p>

<p>
If elves ever leave the Veil again, I hope they meet more Matan like Melisende.<br>
She is proof that even fire can be tender.

  Personal Notes of Maya of the Hrívë Court<br>
  On Freydis of the Alnhama Republic
</h2>

<p>
If Melisende is a flame that trembles, then Freydis is a spark that leaps.
</p>

<p>
She is tall by Matan standards, nearly my height plus half again, with a lithe, athletic form shaped by running, climbing, and—if her stories are true—several daring escapes from the balconies of merchant lords. Her skin is fair, her features sharp, her lips full and often curled into a mischievous smile that unsettles me more than I wish to admit.
</p>

<p>
Her hair is cropped into a sleek black bob.<br>
Her eyes cannot be disguised—icy blue, bright as winter stars.<br>
And when she looks at me with them, I feel she sees far more than I intend.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">On Her Profession</h3>

<p>
Freydis is a spy. She says it openly, though never clearly enough that anyone else could be sure. Her manner shifts with her company—tone, posture, gestures—so fluidly it seems instinctive.
</p>

<p>
In markets, she is loud and brash.<br>
In temples, she becomes soft and reverent.<br>
With me, she becomes… gentle, in her own wry way.
</p>

<p>
Orphaned young, she was raised by the Alnhaman merchant guild, trained to slip unseen, listen at doors, and steal secrets. For her, deception is as natural as breath.
</p>

<p>
I had never imagined a life lived entirely in shadows. I am still unsure how she carries it so lightly.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">The Incident of the Stolen Trinket</h3>

<p>
I must admit—embarrassingly—that she once stole a small relic from me: a crystal sphere with quiet elven glamour, precious mostly for sentimental reasons.
</p>

<p>
She later claimed she took it “to test my awareness.”<br>
I suspect she simply wanted to see if she could.
</p>

<p>
When I realized it was gone, I panicked. My illusions scattered like frightened birds. Freydis laughed—until she became hopelessly lost in a maze of my conjuring, running into the same illusory tree three times before surrendering.
</p>

<p>
I reclaimed the sphere.<br>
She called it an “educational exchange.”<br>
I was too flustered to reply.
</p>

<p>
It was my first lesson in human deceit—not malicious, but effortless. And it taught me that my magic alone is not always enough to protect myself.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">What She Taught Me</h3>

<p>
Freydis taught me to watch the world differently—to see how humans mask their intentions, how danger can wear politeness, and how safety can appear stern.
</p>

<p>She taught me to:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
  <li>shift my posture to appear smaller or larger</li>
  <li>use body language to blend into crowds</li>
  <li>listen for tone changes rather than words alone</li>
  <li>hide without illusions—using mundane shadows</li>
</ul>

<p>
She once said, “Magic is wonderful, Maya, but sometimes disappearing is just stepping where no one is looking.”
</p>

<p>
Among elves, hiding is weaving mist.<br>
Among humans, hiding is understanding perception.<br>
I am unsure which is more subtle.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">On Her Heart</h3>

<p>
Freydis pretends to care for nothing, but in quiet moments she wonders aloud what her life might be if she abandoned her guild. There is longing in her voice—a fragile truth from someone built of masks.
</p>

<p>
For one who lies easily, her honesty strikes like arrows.
</p>

<p>
She is bold, reckless, and maddeningly unpredictable—but I am grateful to her. She showed me a human cunning not born of malice, but necessity; deception as craft; identity as art.
</p>

<p>
I believe she finds me amusing. But I also believe—though she would never say it—that she is fond of me.
</p>

<p>
I hope she finds a life beyond shadows someday.
</p>
