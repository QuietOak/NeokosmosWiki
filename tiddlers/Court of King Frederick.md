  King Frederick
</h1>

<h2 style="color:#f0dfc4; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  The Journal of an Unnamed Courtier<br>
  <span style="font-size:1rem; opacity:0.85;">in the Court of King Frederick of Fresnia</span>
</h2>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Entry I</h3>

<p>
His Majesty, King Frederick of Fresnia, descends from the line of King Arend van Fresning, the Sea-Lord who first raised our banners upon the ruins of old Deutera. From his youth, Frederick spoke not of conquest, but of continuance—claiming that we, heirs to the northern coasts and the gray sea, were chosen to rekindle the light of the drowned empire.
</p>

<p>
He names this dream <em>the Restoration of Atlantis</em>, and many at court whisper “Deutera” once more as if it were a prayer.
</p>

<p>
When he speaks, his voice bears the weight of command and the promise of destiny. Even now, I cannot say whether I fear him or believe him.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Entry II</h3>

<p>
His Majesty’s hunger for relics of the elder world grows without end. The vaults swell with stones that hum, mirrors that glow without flame, and scripts no scholar can read. He calls them echoes of the true age, and each discovery drives him further.
</p>

<p>
Now his gaze turns not to relics of stone, but of flesh.
</p>

<p>
He says the elves—those dwelling unseen in the southern Vale—bear in their blood the key to awakening the power of the ancients.
</p>

<p><strong>Thus began the hunts.</strong></p>

<p>
His banners ride into the Vale not for conquest, but for capture. Those taken are brought to the northern citadel under heavy guard. From that hour, none are seen again. The halls beneath the palace echo faintly at night; I tell myself it is only the wind.
</p>

<p>
The King speaks of necessity—of sacrifice for a golden age reborn. Yet I wonder what kind of light demands so much darkness to kindle it.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Entry III</h3>

<p>
The King no longer sleeps easily. He says a voice calls to him from beneath the sea—calm, vast, promising wisdom beyond mortal reach.
</p>

<p>
He names it the Forgotten God. Yet he claims it once bore a truer name: <strong>the Kraken</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Since these dreams began, wonders and terrors alike have followed. In the northern hills he discovered a sealed cavern, where a warm crystal sphere pulsed with faint light. Deeper still, beneath the mountain roots, he found the <strong>Red Tower</strong>.
</p>

<p>
He says it was not built; its walls grow from the living stone, smooth and curved like bone. When the wind touches it, it hums—a whisper like the deep sea.
</p>

<p>
The King believes it watches him.
<br>He calls it his inheritance.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Entry IV</h3>

<p>
The hunts worsen. The Vale burns in silence. Few soldiers return, and those who do are not the same. Their eyes stare without seeing; they mutter in their sleep and wake at the sound of waves, though we stand leagues from the shore.
</p>

<p>
The King’s voice has changed. Another tone lies beneath it, like an echo not his own. His eyes, once sharp and pale as ice, now reflect light strangely—like water shifting in a deep well.
</p>

<p>
He no longer speaks of restoration, but of <strong>ascension</strong>. He says the gods of the deep still dream beneath the world, and he will be the one to wake them.
</p>

<p>
I think he already has.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#ead7b7; margin-top:1.5rem;">Entry V</h3>

<p>
The King has withdrawn into the Red Tower. None may enter. Its doors have sealed themselves—or so the guards insist—and even the masons cannot find where the seams once lay.
</p>

<p>
Still, his will reaches us. Messengers deliver decrees written in his hand, though the script bends as though the letters root and twist like vines.
</p>

<p><strong>Always the same command:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:1rem; font-style:italic;">
“Find the Atlantean sword. Spare no man, no coin, no blood.”
</p>

<p>
No one knows what blade he seeks—only that he calls it the key of return.
</p>

<p>
At night, the Tower glows faintly through the fog—red as an ember beneath ash. The city grows quiet; even the gulls will not cry near it.
</p>

<p>
I cannot say if our King yet lives, or if something else wears his shape.
</p>

<p>
If these pages are found, know that I served faithfully.  
But I no longer pray for his triumph.
<br>I pray only that the sea keeps its silence…  
and that the dreams do not find me too.
</p>
