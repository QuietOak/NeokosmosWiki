  Personal Notes — Talon of the Boar Tribe
</h2>

<p>
I record these thoughts with a heaviness I do not often feel.  
Of all the many peoples I met during my travels, none baffled—and fascinated—me quite as much as Talon, once chieftain of the Boar Tribe.
</p>

<p>
He was immense, in every sense of the word. Even among the Pictish raiders he dwarfed every warrior, built as though the earth itself had carved him. His chest was broad, his arms thick as tree boughs, and his long dark hair, streaked with red, gave him the appearance of a storm given flesh. His eyes were black as coal and just as unreadable. He towered more than threefold over me, and yet he moved with a quiet confidence that was almost… measured.
</p>

<p>
Where I am talkative, he was silent.<br>
Where I question, he acted.<br>
Where I hesitate, he stepped forward without fear.
</p>

<p>
And still—somehow—we became friends.
</p>

<p>
Talon spoke little, in short, practical sentences, as though words were arrows he saw no point wasting. Complex phrasing irritated him. He once growled at me for using a word he deemed “too many sounds,” and yet he never truly frightened me. For all his fierceness, he treated me with an unexpected gentleness, though he masked it with brusque commands. It was in his nature to give orders, and in my nature to consider and question — but we found a strange balance between us.
</p>

<p>
He lived as the Picts of his homeland do: by raiding, by taking, by believing dominance to be the measure of worth. Violence to him was not cruelty, but simply life — a worldview I can understand only from a distance, as one may study storms without standing inside them. And yet, I saw moments in him—small ones, but true—of kindness. He protected those he deemed unable to protect themselves, especially women and children, so long as they followed his strict customs. To him, this was not mercy, but duty.
</p>

<p>
Talon guided me across lands that no elf had walked in an age, teaching me how the countless tribes of the so-called “Picts” differed from one another. He knew the woods, the mountains, and the plains as though he felt them beneath his skin, and though he rarely explained his thoughts, he kept me safe in ways I understood only later.
</p>

<p>
His tribe — the Boar Tribe — was small and not well known, but respected as fighters and feared as mercenaries. They fought for any who would pay them, a custom I found baffling, but Talon spoke of it as though it were as natural as breathing. They prized strength and endurance, and Talon embodied their values as wholly as the bear embodies the mountain.
</p>

<p>
But all that the Boar Tribe was, all that Talon had led, ended in one night of fire and betrayal.
</p>

<p>
I was absent when it happened. I still struggle with the guilt of that truth. The Fresnians attacked under darkness, leaving no survivors. Talon never spoke of his grief, and at first I thought him untouched by it. But now, looking back with clearer eyes, I see how wrong I was. Everything he did thereafter — every risk taken, every reckless charge, every quiet, brooding moment — was shaped by a hunger for vengeance deeper than any wound of the flesh. He carried his tribe’s death like an unhealed scar beneath his ribs.
</p>

<p>
Only later did I realize the attack had not been upon the tribe at all — but upon <em>Talon</em> himself.
</p>

<p>
The Boar Tribe had been eradicated because of him.  
Because in him was the potential for something dangerous: a leader strong enough to unite the tribes as Karn once did; a leader who might shake kingdoms and topple empires; a leader who could have done again what the Picts did to Deutera Atlantis long ago.  
Those who struck at him did so not from hatred, but fear.
</p>

<p>
I cannot condone the violence Talon embodied, nor the customs he upheld — yet I cannot deny that he was remarkable, shaped by a world harsher than any elven heart could endure. He taught me that strength takes many forms, and that friendship sometimes grows where no one expects it.
</p>

<p>
I hope he finds peace, though I know he walks a path where peace rarely lives.
